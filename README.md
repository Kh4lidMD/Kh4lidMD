👋 Hello there! I'm Khalid, a 17-year-old self-learner and programmer from Syria, currently based in Qatar. I've been into programming for 3 years now, and my favorite language is Python.

👨‍💻 I'm particularly interested in AI, especially large language models, and I love exploring new technologies and tools. I've also developed a passion for web scraping using Selenium, which has proved to be a powerful tool for me.

📚 My programming journey started with HTML and CSS, then I moved on to JavaScript. But once I discovered Python, I knew I found my language of choice. I've been working with it ever since, constantly learning and improving my skills.

🤖 I'm also a Discord developer with Pycord, which has given me a great opportunity to work with APIs and build cool bots. If you're interested in chatting, you can find me on Discord as MrNotFree#0001.

🎨 On top of programming, I'm a medium-level designer.
